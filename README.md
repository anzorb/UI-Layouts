#BB10-UI-Stack#

***High performance HTML5 Framework for BlackBerry 10 using Backbone and Require.js.***

###Why use this framework?###

***1. Performance***  
This frameworks is built from the ground up with performance in mind.  
There is zero JavaScript detecting screen heights/width and other calculations that are better left to the CSS renderer.  
100% hardware accelerated.  

***2. Appearance***  
This framework will stay as close to Cascades &reg; as possible - both in looks and User Experience.

***3. Smart***  
You don't have to worry about which tabs overflow, and which don't. There's logic to handle all that.

***4. AppBuilder support***  
Create a project from scratch using AppBuilder ([https://github.com/anzorb/AppBuilder](https://github.com/anzorb/AppBuilder))

***5. 100% Webkit Browser compliant***  
Test your code directly in the browser, no need for simulators. (When using the browser blackberry APIs are not available).

***6. Landscape support out of the box***  
This framework uses very efficient CSS code selectors, flex-boxes, relative widths and heights. In landscape the action-bar shrinks to have more room for content.

***6. Keyboard series BlackBerry 10 support out of the box***  
The title speaks for itself, no need to worry if your app is compatible with future BB10 handhelds.
